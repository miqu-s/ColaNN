# ColaNN
ColaNN is a simple project hacked together in a week, and is designed for a school project, as a proof of concept. Due to popular demand with people asking me about it, I'm releasing the source right here on github.<br>

  You might need to do some small changes with the general codebase, as this is designed to use DML instead of cuda or the cpu. Otherwise, the code is already fully working.
